    <p>Notta word dictionary was designed as an official repository for today's un-words that are not found the other traditional dictionaries. It is meant to have fun and share with family friends and co-workers. In today's society we all get crazy and say silly things... but how often is it recognized by people. Usually just your friends and family know about these little Notta words.</p>

    <p>After you have done your "due diligence" (research) the next thing in trade marking anything is getting someone to recognize you as the owner . Thats where we come in.   By submitting your word to us  we trade mark it for you on nottaword.com for world-wide recognition and possibly even publication in a world wide dictionary.</p>

    <p>We wanted to create a fun friendly interface as so many other web sites have done to enjoy our crazy notta words with each other. Now Go Be Productful and create an UN word!</p>

    <p>In short... we help you to prove your claim by documentation, history!! Hey, you have an Official "Time Stamped" receipt from us, and everyone can see it, you got dibs on your word!</p>

    <p>Notice: We don't want post's that are offensive to the point of being viciously personal, racist, exceedingly profane, violent or excessively graphic in nature. It's a very hard thing to judge, but we'll do our best.
We the 'Nottaword' editors reserve the right to edit the rating ONLY, of your word! ie. (G, PG, R, RI, X)</p>
