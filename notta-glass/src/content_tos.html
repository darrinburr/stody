Terms of Service | Acceptable Use Policies
1. Your Agreement with Google

This License Agreement for Google App Engine (the “Agreement”) is made and entered into by and between Google Inc., a Delaware corporation, with offices at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View 94043 (“Google”) and the business entity agreeing to these terms (“Customer”). This Agreement is effective as of the date Customer clicks the "I Accept" button below (the "Effective Date"). If you are accepting on behalf of Customer, you represent and warrant that: (i) if you have full legal authority to bind Customer to this Agreement; (ii) you have read and understand this Agreement; and (iii) you agree, on behalf of Customer, to this Agreement. If you do not have the legal authority to bind Customer, please do not click the "I Accept" button below. This Agreement governs Customer's access to and use of the Service.
1. Licenses.

1.1 From Google to Customer. Subject to this Agreement, Google grants to Customer a worldwide, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, non-exclusive, terminable, limited license to (a) use the Service, (b) integrate the Services into any Application and (c) use any Software provided by Google as part of the Service.

1.2 From Customer to Google. By submitting, posting or displaying any Application (including Customer Content) on or through the Service, Customer gives Google a worldwide, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, non-exclusive, terminable, limited license to reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute any Application (including Customer Content) for the sole purpose of enabling Google to provide Customer with the Service in accordance with the Agreement.
2. Provision of the Service.

2.1 Console. Google will provide the Service to Customer. As part of receiving the Service, Customer will have access to the Admin Console, through which Customer may administer the Service.

2.2 Facilities and Data Transfer. All facilities used to store and process an Application (including Customer Content) will adhere to reasonable security standards no less protective than the security standards at facilities where Google processes and stores its own information of a similar type. Google has implemented at least industry standard systems and procedures to ensure the security and confidentiality of an Application and Customer Content, protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of an Application and Customer Content, and protect against unauthorized access to or use of an Application and Customer Content. Google may process and store an Application and Customer Content in the United States or any other country in which Google or its agents maintain facilities. By using the Service, Customer consents to this processing and storage of the Application and Customer Content.

2.3 Accounts. Customer must have an Account to use the Service, and is responsible for the information it provides to create the Account, the security of its passwords for the Account, and for any use of its Account. If Customer becomes aware of any unauthorized use of its password or its Account, Customer will notify Google as promptly as possible.

2.4 Privacy Policies. The Service shall be subject to Google’s Privacy Policy. Changes to the Privacy Policy will be made as stated in the applicable policy. In addition, Google is enrolled in the U.S. Department of Commerce Safe Harbor Program and will remain enrolled in this program or a comparable successor program throughout the Term of the Agreement.

2.5 New Applications. Google may make new applications, tools, features or functionality available from time to time through the Service, the use of which may be contingent upon Customer’s Agreement to additional terms.

2.6 Modifications.

    To the Service. Subject to Section 7.2 (Deprecation), Google may make commercially reasonable Updates to the Service from time to time. If Google makes a material change to the Service, Google will inform Customer, provided that Customer has subscribed with Google to be informed about such change.
    To the Agreement. Google may make changes to this Agreement, including pricing from time to time. Unless otherwise noted by Google, material changes to the Agreement will become effective ninety days after they are posted, except if the changes apply to new functionality in which case they will be effective immediately. If Customer does not agree to the revised Agreement, please stop using the Service. Google will post any modification to this Agreement to the Terms URL.

3. Payment Terms.

3.1 Free Quota. The Service is provided to Customer without charge up to the Fee Threshold.

3.2 Online Billing. Google will issue an electronic bill to the Customer for all charges accrued above the Fee Threshold. Charges are solely based on Google's measurements of Customer’s use of the Service and may include monthly fees. For use above the Fee Threshold, Customer shall be responsible for all charges up to the amount set in the Account and shall pay all charges in U.S. Dollars or in such other currency as agreed to in writing by the parties. Customer shall pay all charges in accordance with the payment terms in the Service FAQ.

3.3 Delinquent Payments. Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less). Google reserves the right to suspend your Account for any late payments.

3.4 Taxes. Customer is responsible for any Taxes, and Customer will pay Google for the Services without any reduction for Taxes. If Google is obligated to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes will be invoiced to Customer, unless Customer provides Google with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. If Customer is required by law to withhold any Taxes from its payments to Google, Customer must provide Google with an official tax receipt or other appropriate documentation to support such payments.

3.5 Invoice Disputes & Refunds. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Customer waives all claims relating to charges unless claimed within sixty days after the charge (this does not affect any Customer rights with its credit card issuer). Refunds (if any) are at the discretion of Google and will only be in the form of credit for the Service. Nothing in this Agreement obligates Google to extend credit to any party.
4. Customer Obligations.

4.1 Compliance. Customer is solely responsible for the Application (including Customer Content). Customer is responsible for making sure the Application or Customer Content complies with the Acceptable Use Policy. If Google suspects non-compliance, Google reserves the right to review the Application or Customer Content to ensure Customer’s compliance with the Acceptable Use Policy.

4.2 Privacy. Customer will protect the privacy and legal rights of its End Users under all applicable laws and regulations, which includes a legally adequate privacy notice communicated from Customer. Customer may have the ability to access, monitor, use, or disclose Customer Content submitted by End Users through the Service. Customer will obtain and maintain any required consents from End Users to allow Customer’s access, monitoring, use or disclosure of Customer Content. Further, Customer will notify its End Users that any information provided as part of the Application will be made available to Google as part of Google providing the Service.

4.3 Restrictions. Customer will not, and will not allow third parties under its control to: (a) copy, modify, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, decompile, translate, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to extract the source code of the Service or any component thereof (subject to Section 4.4 below); (b) use the Service for High Risk Activities; (c) sublicense, resell, or distribute the Service or any component thereof separate from any integrated Customer offering; (d) use the Service to create a substantially similar product or service; (e) create multiple Applications to simulate or act as a single Application or otherwise access the Service in a manner intended to avoid incurring fees; (f) use the Service to operate or enable any telecommunications service or in connection with any Application that allows End Users to place calls to or receive calls from any public switched telephone network; or (g) process or store any Customer Content that is subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations maintained by the Department of State. Customer acknowledges that the Service is not HIPAA compliant and Customer is solely responsible for any applicable compliance with HIPAA.

4.4 Open Source Components. Open source software licenses for components of the Service released under an open source license constitute separate written Agreements. Open source software is listed in the Documentation. To the limited extent the open source software licenses expressly supersede this Agreement, the open source license instead governs Customer’s Agreement with Google for the specific included open source components of the Service, or use of the Service (as may be applicable).

4.5 Third Party Requests. Customer is responsible for responding to Third Party Requests. Google will, to the extent allowed by law and by the terms of the Third Party Request: (a) promptly notify Customer of its receipt of a Third Party Request; (b) comply with Customer’s reasonable requests regarding its efforts to oppose a Third Party Request; and (c) if the information is solely held by Google and reasonably accessible by Google, provide Customer with the information required for Customer to respond to the Third Party Request.

4.6 Documentation. Google will provide Documentation for Customer’s use of the Service. The Documentation may specify restrictions in how Applications may be built and Customer agrees to any such restrictions specified.
5. Suspension and Removals.

5.1 Suspension/Removals. If Customer becomes aware that any Application, Customer Content, or an End User’s use of an Application violates the Acceptable Use Policy, Customer will immediately suspend the Application, remove the applicable Customer Content, or suspend access to an End User (as may be applicable). If Customer fails to suspend or remove as noted in the prior sentence, Google may specifically request that Customer do so. If Customer fails to comply with Google’s request to do so within twenty-four hours, then Google may suspend Google accounts of the applicable End Users, or disable the Application (as applicable) until such violation is corrected.

5.2 Emergency Security Issues. Despite the foregoing, if there is an Emergency Security Issue, then Google may automatically suspend the offending End User account, or the Application. Suspension will be to the minimum extent required, and of the minimum duration, to prevent or terminate the Emergency Security Issue. If Google suspends an End User or the Application, for any reason, without prior notice to Customer, at Customer’s request, Google will provide Customer the reason for the suspension as soon as is reasonably possible.
6. Intellectual Property Rights; Brand Features.

6.1 Intellectual Property Rights. Except as expressly set forth herein, this Agreement does not grant either party any rights, implied or otherwise, to the other’s content or any of the other’s intellectual property. As between the parties, Customer owns all Intellectual Property Rights in any Application and Customer Content, and Google owns all Intellectual Property Rights in the Service.

6.2 Brand Features Limitation. If Customer wants to display Google Brand Features in connection with its use of the Service, Customer must obtain written permission from Google through process specified in the Trademark Guidelines. For the sole purpose of providing the Service, Customer permits Google to display any Brand Features that may appear in its Application. Any use of a party’s Brand Features will inure to the benefit of the party holding Intellectual Property Rights to those Brand Features. A party may revoke the other party’s right to use its Brand Features pursuant to this Agreement with written notice to the other and a reasonable period to stop the use.
7. Technical Support Service

7.1 By Customer. Customer is responsible for technical support of its Application.

7.2 Deprecation.

    Deprecation with a Deprecation Period. If Google in its discretion chooses to cease providing the current Version of the Service whether through discontinuation of the Service or by upgrading the Service to a newer Version, the current Version of the Service will be deprecated and become the Deprecated Version of the Service. Google will issue an announcement if the current Version of the Service will be deprecated. For a period of 3 years after an announcement (the “Deprecation Period”), Google will use commercially reasonable efforts to continue to operate the Deprecated Version of the Service and to respond to problems with the Deprecated Version of the Service deemed by Google in its discretion to be critical. During the Deprecation Period, Google is not required to add any new features to the Deprecated Version of the Service; provided that if Google does so, such additional features do not extend the Deprecation Period for the Deprecated Version.
    Deprecation without a Deprecation Period. Google reserves the right in its discretion to cease providing all or any part of the Deprecated Version of the Service immediately without any notice if:
        Customer has breached any provision of this Agreement (or has acted in manner that clearly shows that Customer does not intend to, or is unable to comply with the provisions of this Agreement); or
        Google is required to do so by law (for example, due to a change to the law governing the provision of the Deprecated Version of the Service); or
        the Deprecated Version of the Service relies on data or services provided by a third party partner and the relationship with such partner (i) has expired or been terminated or (ii) requires Google to change the way Google provides the data or services through the Deprecated Version of the Service; or
        providing the Deprecated Version of the Service could create a substantial economic burden as determined by Google in its reasonable good faith judgment; or
        providing the Deprecated Version of the Service could create a security risk or material technical burden as determined by Google in its reasonable good faith judgment.
    Experimental or Labs. At any time prior to discontinuing the current version of the Service or upgrading to a new version of the Service, Google may, in its discretion as part of its continuing innovation to provide the best possible experience for its users, label certain features or functionality of the Service as "experimental." This Section 7.2 does not apply to any features or functionality labeled as "experimental" or any version of the Service labeled as “labs.” 

8. Confidential Information.

8.1 Obligations. Each party will: (a) protect the other party’s Confidential Information with the same standard of care it uses to protect its own Confidential Information; and (b) not disclose the Confidential Information, except to Affiliates, Employees and agents who need to know it and who have agreed in writing to keep it confidential. Each party (and any affiliates, Employees and agents to whom it has disclosed Confidential Information) may use Confidential Information only to exercise rights and fulfill obligations under this Agreement, while using reasonable care to protect it. Each party is responsible for any actions of its Affiliates, Employees and agents in violation of this Section.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) Customer is permitted to state publicly that it is a customer of the Service, consistent with the Trademark Guidelines, and (b) Customer consents to Google’s use of Customer’s name in a general customer list, but only if Customer is not the only Customer appearing on the list. For clarification, neither party needs to seek approval from the other if the party is repeating a public statement that is substantially similar to a public statement that has been previously approved.
