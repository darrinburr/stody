   <h2>Technology</h2>
   <p>The Technology is pretty simple. We started with Python, use Google's Bigtable 
   (the same place google earth resides) for storage because of its reliability, scalability 
   cost and performance... tie it all together with google's appengine... format everything with CSS3
   and volia!</p>
   
   <p>Its important to note: we use the Eclipse IDE with the pydev and appengine plugins.. that makes development, 
   testing, and deployment an absolute breeze... We also use linux(Ubuntu) so our machines don't crash ;) 
   ..which saves time and frustration. ;) </p>
