  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p><b>We never share your personal information with our advertisers.</b>
    Notta Corporation ad targeting is done entirely anonymously. If advertisers
    select demographic targeting for their ads, Notta Corporation automatically
    matches those ads to the appropriate audience. Advertisers only receive
    anonymous data reports.

  <p>
    <b>Information you've shared with everyone - as well as your name, profile
    picture, gender and networks - could be seen by anyone on the internet.</b>
    Please be aware that it will be visible to anyone viewing your word, and
    applications and websites you and your friends use will be able to access it.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>We are committed to protecting minors who use Notta Corporation apps.</b>
    Until their eighteenth birthday, minors don't have public search listings
    created for them, and the visibility of their information is limited to
    friends and networks, even if they've chosen to make it available to everyone.
    This does not apply to name, images/picture, gender and networks, which are
    visible to everyone so real world friends can recognize them.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Transactional Information.</b> We may retain the details of transactions
    or payments you make to Notta Corporation. If you do not want us to store
    your payment source account number, you can remove it using by selecting
    "do not save payment information".
